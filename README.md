## Overview
This project simulates a realistic enterprise Active Directory environment to demonstrate both offensive attack paths and defensive hardening controls.

The objective was to identify common AD misconfigurations, simulate safe attack techniques, enable enterprise-grade audit logging, and validate measurable improvements in security posture.

The lab follows a structured workflow:

1. Build Active Directory infrastructure  
2. Simulate common attack techniques  
3. Enable and validate security telemetry  
4. Apply hardening controls  
5. Re-test and confirm improved posture  

This reflects real-world security engineering practices in hybrid red and blue team environments.

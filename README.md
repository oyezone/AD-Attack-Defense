## Overview

This project simulates a hybrid enterprise Active Directory environment to demonstrate a full attack-to-defense lifecycle within a Windows domain.

The lab was designed to replicate real-world security engineering workflows, including:

- Active Directory misconfiguration analysis
- Kerberos service ticket abuse simulation (Kerberoast surface)
- Privilege escalation detection
- Authentication telemetry analysis
- Advanced audit policy configuration
- Defensive hardening validation

Rather than focusing solely on offensive tooling, this project emphasizes controlled attack simulation followed by measurable defensive improvement.

The goal was not only to generate attack telemetry, but to:

- Enable enterprise-grade logging
- Validate detection visibility
- Reduce attack surface exposure
- Confirm security posture improvements through evidence

This reflects the responsibilities of modern Security Engineers, Detection Engineers, and Blue Team practitioners operating in corporate Active Directory environments.
